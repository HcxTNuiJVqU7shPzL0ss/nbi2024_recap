---

## 1a
Use input to ask the user for an integer.\
Save the value in a variable.\
Convert the value of the variable to an integer.\
Print the value to check it has been done correctly.

---

## 1b
Ask the user for another integer.\
Print out the sum of not integers, i.e. first + second.\
Test by coming up with two numbers and sum it up in your head.\
Check that the program calculates correctly.

---

## 2a
Now it is time to purchase winter clothing.\
You spot a new jacket that costs 2000 SEK.\
It is on sale, with a 50% discount.\
Write a program which calculates what you 
should pay.

---

## 2b
Remake the program to allow the user to input a 
percentage for discount.\
Test by making up a percentage and calculate what 
the program should return, prior to running it.\
E.g., 10%, which is 200 SEK.\
Then the jacket should cost 2000 - 200 = 1800 SEK.

### Programmering med Python, 20yhp

#### Summary and Explanation

Originally took this course starting in 2024, did not finish all.  
Taking this course once more starting in 2025.

Between the first and the new course redid most of the exercises to 
get back into it.  
Due to this, there are some various versions of files available.  

Mainly have been working a lot on my own "between the courses".  
However, started also to perform some work for the "new course", 
as well as at times copying files from the "OG course in."  

When applicable, will attempt to ensure each readme file will have 
some information explaining what is what.
